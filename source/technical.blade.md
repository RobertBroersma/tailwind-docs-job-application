Thanks to my professional background, I'm an expert on the frontend. My specialty is React, but I wouldn't call myself a React developer or even a Javascript developer. Rather I like to think of myself as a developer and pick the tools that fit my goals!

I have some experience on the backend in side projects ([Sjef](/projects#sjef) is an example!), in Python and Django. In my early days I started with PHP and later worked with Zend Framework, Symfony and CodeIgniter. So I'm familiar with PHP and the MVC design pattern! Nowadays I like to do my backend stuff in Node.js and serverless functions.

My timezone has plenty of overlap with yours, and I also very much prefer not programming alone! I don't mind working evenings, with a few exceptions, but 4 hours a day minimum is no problem at all. I also have a few months experience in working remotely apart from the obligatory ones during this pandemic.
