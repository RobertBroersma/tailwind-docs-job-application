Hi All! I'll be speaking in first person from here onwards. I'm Robert, a fellow maker living in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands. I love Tailwind and it's philosophy, and I'd love
to join you in building the future!

I've been working as a freelance front-end developer for 5 years.
The last 2 years were full-time as a senior frontend developer at
Vodafone Netherlands. As part of a small team I worked on creating
their complex checkout flow from scratch in React. While I've
learned a lot as a freelancer, I'm ready to do something more
meaningful and contribute to the community!

Recently [I've been contributing to RedwoodJS](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues?q=author%3ARobertBroersma+)
to get started on my new goal. I love working on tools that helps
people to make great things, so Tailwind would be a perfect fit!
