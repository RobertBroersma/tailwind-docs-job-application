Hi All! I'll be speaking in first person from here onwards. I'm Robert, a fellow maker living in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands. I love Tailwind and it's philosophy, and I'd love
to join you in building the future!

I've been working as a freelance front-end developer for 5 years.
The last 2 years were full-time as a senior frontend developer at
Vodafone Netherlands. As part of a small team I worked on creating
their complex checkout flow from scratch in React. While I've
learned a lot as a freelancer, I'm ready to do something more
meaningful and contribute to the community!

Recently [I've been contributing to RedwoodJS](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues?q=author%3ARobertBroersma+)
to get started on my new goal. I love working on tools that helps
people to make great things, so Tailwind would be a perfect fit!

## Why we're a great fit

> "You're a strong problem solver who loves to learn — we're not experts in everything and we don't expect you to be either. You might not call yourself a designer, but you know great UI design when you see it and you know when something isn't up to par."

You described me! I love to learn new things. Sometimes I like to [write about it](https://dev.to/robertbroersma). Recently I leared about AST to implement [a custom Babel plugin for RedwoodJS](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/512) to be able to render Cells in tooling like Jest.

I am a **problem solver**. I created [Sjef](/projects#sjef) because I wanted to gain weight, and creating meal plans and shopping lists every week cost me a lot of time and effort!

I created the [Chord Trainer](/projects#chord-trainer) app because I wanted to practice playing chords by heart on piano, but playing them in order all the
time was boring!

I'm not a designer, but I know great UI design when I see it. I hope my
[illustrations](/projects#illustrations) show that I know my way around a color
scheme. I also completed a dozen of projects at a creative agency
called [CHUNK](https://chunkagency.com/), where I
worked closely with a designer to implement pixel perfect designs!

I know you mentioned you don't care if I went to school, but I'd like
to mention the program I followed, **Creative Technology** at the University of Twente,
because it fits your profile very well! The program teaches how to
make things. Useful things, fun things, weird things (art!). We were
taught methods for brainstorming, ideation, problem solving,
iteration. All the fundamentals for innovation. It was left up to us
what technologies we wanted to use. I think it's perfect for makers!

## My Projects
Next to my professional life I've been making stuff for as long as I can remember. Here are some of my favourite past projects!

### Apps
@component('_partials.card', ['href' => 'https://sjef.netlify.app/'])
<img
  class="w-48 flex-shrink-0 object-cover"
  src="/img/logo-sjef.png"
  alt="Sjef App"
/>
<div class="p-6 flex flex-col">
  <h4 class="font-semibold text-black uppercase text-xl">Sjef</h4>
  <p class="pt-2">
    Sjef automatically generates mealplans and grocery lists based on
    your nutritional requirements. I'm no longer working on this
    project, but I spun up the old landing page recently!
  </p>
  <div class="pt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 mt-auto">
    Built with Angular 2+, Python and Django
  </div>
</div>

@component('_partials.card', ['href' => 'https://chord-trainer.netlify.app/'])
<img

/>
<div class="p-6 flex flex-col">
  <h4 class="font-semibold text-black uppercase text-xl">
    Chord Trainer
  </h4>
  <p class="pt-2">
    This is a small web app I created to practice chords on a piano.
    It works with Web MIDI Api and let's you connect a MIDI piano!

<div class="flex justify-center items-center w-48 flex-shrink-0">

</div>
<div class="p-6 flex flex-col">
  <h4 class="font-semibold text-black uppercase text-xl">
    Warehouse Worker
  </h4>
  <p class="pt-2">
    A Flash game I made about 10 years ago! Unfortunately it's
    difficult to play it now, since it's Flash, but a few people
    uploaded videos to YouTube with solutions, which was very cool to
    see for young me.
  </p>
  <div class="pt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 mt-auto">
    Built with Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3.0
  </div>
</div>
@endcomponent

@component('_partials.card', ['href' => 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robertbroersma.ampere'])
<div class="flex justify-center items-center w-48 flex-shrink-0">

</div>
<div class="p-6 flex flex-col">
  <h4 class="font-semibold text-black uppercase text-xl">Ampère</h4>
  <p class="pt-2">
    Essentially Warehouse Worker for Android, with more features and
    new graphics. Created for nostalgia and learning game development
    for Android. Not quite as popular as the Flash game, but fun to
    make nevertheless!

## What excites me
As you probably know by now I like to make things, so I'm always on the lookout for ideas and tools that improve development experience. The tools below are some of my favourite.

### State Machines & XState
Ever since I started following David Khourshid he has gotten me more
and more excited about the benefits of state machines. It took me a
while to wrap my head around XState, but now I can't imagine
developing any complex feature without it.

One of my favourite parts of XState is the visualizer. It makes it
so much easier to talk about complex functionality with technical
<em>and</em> non-technical people!

Also, [@xstate/test](https://css-tricks.com/model-based-testing-in-react-with-state-machines/) will automatically write my tests? Hell yeah!

### Serverless 
I never need to think about servers again? Sign me up!

### Netlify &amp; Vercel
Git push and my website is live? Yes please!

### Tailwind
I swear I'm not just saying that! I've been using Styled Components
for quite a while now, but often it doesn't feel quite right. From
game development I've learned that using composition over
inheritance will often give you more flexibility.

Then I read about Theme UI, Styled System and...
_Chakra UI_, which is just excellent! I can compose my styles
right there in the JSX and when I need something reusable I'll
extract the component! Not long after that, only recently, I learned
that Chakra UI was heavily inspired by Tailwind CSS. Almost
immediately I got sold on it and now here I am applying for this
job!

### Eliminating Design Handover
I don't like the term handover, because it implies a waterfall
methodology. I think iteration is the most important thing in
innovation. This is why I'm excited about tools like
[Blocks UI](https://blocks-ui.com/), [Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom), and especially
[Modulz](https://www.modulz.app/).
Designers creating component libraries that can directly be used by
developers, right there in their design tool, with the design system
constraints enforced, just makes total sense!

I think the concept of Modulz could also work very well with
Tailwind. Design Tailwind UI components once and publish component
libraries for React, Vue, Svelte, and anything else! I would love to
work on something like that.

## My Technology
Thanks to my professional background, I'm an expert on the frontend. My specialty is React, but I wouldn't call myself a React developer or even a Javascript developer. Rather I like to think of myself as a developer and pick the tools that fit my goals!

I have some experience on the backend in side projects ([Sjef](/projects#sjef) is an example!), in Python and Django. In my early days I started with PHP and later worked with Zend Framework, Symfony and CodeIgniter. So I'm familiar with PHP and the MVC design pattern! Nowadays I like to do my backend stuff in Node.js and serverless functions.

My timezone has plenty of overlap with yours, and I also very much prefer not programming alone! I don't mind working evenings, with a few exceptions, but 4 hours a day minimum is no problem at all. I also have a few months experience in working remotely apart from the obligatory ones during this pandemic.

## To be continued…?

Thanks for making it this far! I hope this page gave you a good overview of me. I would love the opportunity to meet you, talk shop and exchange ideas!

Best,
