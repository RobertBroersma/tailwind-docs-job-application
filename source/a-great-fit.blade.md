> "You're a strong problem solver who loves to learn â€” we're not experts in everything and we don't expect you to be either. You might not call yourself a designer, but you know great UI design when you see it and you know when something isn't up to par."

You described me! I love to learn new things. Sometimes I like to [write about it](https://dev.to/robertbroersma). Recently I leared about AST to implement [a custom Babel plugin for RedwoodJS](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/512) to be able to render Cells in tooling like Jest.

I am a **problem solver**. I created [Sjef](/projects#sjef) because I wanted to gain weight, and creating meal plans and shopping lists every week cost me a lot of time and effort!

I created the [Chord Trainer](/projects#chord-trainer) app because I wanted to practice playing chords by heart on piano, but playing them in order all the
time was boring!

I'm not a designer, but I know great UI design when I see it. I hope my
[illustrations](/projects#illustrations) show that I know my way around a color
scheme. I also completed a dozen of projects at a creative agency
called [CHUNK](https://chunkagency.com/), where I
worked closely with a designer to implement pixel perfect designs!

I know you mentioned you don't care if I went to school, but I'd like
to mention the program I followed, **Creative Technology** at the University of Twente,
because it fits your profile very well! The program teaches how to
make things. Useful things, fun things, weird things (art!). We were
taught methods for brainstorming, ideation, problem solving,
iteration. All the fundamentals for innovation. It was left up to us
what technologies we wanted to use. I think it's perfect for makers!
