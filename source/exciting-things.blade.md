As you probably know by now I like to make things, so I'm always on the lookout for ideas and tools that improve development experience. The tools below are some of my favourite.

## State Machines & XState
Ever since I started following David Khourshid he has gotten me more
and more excited about the benefits of state machines. It took me a
while to wrap my head around XState, but now I can't imagine
developing any complex feature without it.

One of my favourite parts of XState is the visualizer. It makes it
so much easier to talk about complex functionality with technical
<em>and</em> non-technical people!

Also, [@xstate/test](https://css-tricks.com/model-based-testing-in-react-with-state-machines/) will automatically write my tests? Hell yeah!

## Serverless 
I never need to think about servers again? Sign me up!

## Netlify &amp; Vercel
Git push and my website is live? Yes please!

## Tailwind
I swear I'm not just saying that! I've been using Styled Components
for quite a while now, but often it doesn't feel quite right. From
game development I've learned that using composition over
inheritance will often give you more flexibility.

Then I read about Theme UI, Styled System and...
_Chakra UI_, which is just excellent! I can compose my styles
right there in the JSX and when I need something reusable I'll
extract the component! Not long after that, only recently, I learned
that Chakra UI was heavily inspired by Tailwind CSS. Almost
immediately I got sold on it and now here I am applying for this
job!

## Eliminating Design Handover
I don't like the term handover, because it implies a waterfall
methodology. I think iteration is the most important thing in
innovation. This is why I'm excited about tools like
[Blocks UI](https://blocks-ui.com/), [Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom), and especially
[Modulz](https://www.modulz.app/).
Designers creating component libraries that can directly be used by
developers, right there in their design tool, with the design system
constraints enforced, just makes total sense!

I think the concept of Modulz could also work very well with
Tailwind. Design Tailwind UI components once and publish component
libraries for React, Vue, Svelte, and anything else! I would love to
work on something like that.
